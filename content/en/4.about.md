About

#subtitle
### The Scripter of Subnets, the Sultan of Syntax, and the Maestro of Markdown.

#intro
By day, he's an elite network automation architect, weaving Ansible, Terraform, and Python into seamless symphonies that orchestrate firewalls, clouds, and command lines alike. Whether he's taming a Palo Alto config or air-gapping a NetBox deployment into a zero-trust fortress, Carl’s got the CLI calm of a veteran and the creativity of a coder-poet.

By night? Probably optimizing his Raspberry Pi lab, building CI/CD pipelines that test and deploy faster than a Git commit, or debugging an obscure iTerm2 quirk — all while plotting the next blog drop for carlbaccus.com. Oh, and he likes his themes dark. Naturally.
